# Supabase Change Policy

**NEVER** make changes to the Supabase database without explicit user approval first. This includes:

- Creating, altering, or dropping tables
- Adding, modifying, or removing columns
- Changing RLS policies
- Running migrations (`apply_migration`)
- Executing DDL via `execute_sql`
- Deploying or modifying edge functions

Before any database change, **describe the exact change** you want to make and **ask for confirmation**. Multiple people work on this project and everyone needs to be aware of schema changes.

Read-only queries (SELECT) are fine without asking.
